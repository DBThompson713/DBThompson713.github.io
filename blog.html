                                  I started at coder academy today. I'm excited to get at it and be immersed in coding. 
                                  Gonna be spending a lot of time in North sydney for the next while.

                                      I'm pretty jazzed to start doing something I'm interested. I've worked
                                      too many jobs and started too many careers solely for money or
                                      short term gain.
