                          I started at coder academy today. I'm excited to get at it and be immersed in coding. 
                          Gonna be spending a lot of time in North sydney for the next while.

                              I'm pretty jazzed to start doing something I'm interested. I've worked
                              too many jobs and started too many careers solely for money or
                              short term gain.

                  <p>Another long day down at the code mine. Spent all day slaving over a hot tea, sitting in a beanbag

                Today is exactly 1 month since I started at Coderacademy. It's been such a ride so far. We've covered so much already. Learning something new everyday has been
                awesome, and is something I look forward to continuing.
