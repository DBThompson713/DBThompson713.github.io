                <p>It's time. I've stood on the outside for too long. I've worked too many jobs and started too many careers solely for money or short term gain.</p>
                <p>I have enrolled in coderacademy. It's time to start building something for the long term.</p>

              <p>My first project for coderacademy is done!</p>
              <p>What greater good does it serve? what world issue does it solve?</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>well... it's a game specifically designed to be annoying. Which i think it accomplishes quite well</p>
              <p>Oh. And it has 8 bit graphics. So that's cool</p>

              <div class="block">
                <p>I'm Sitting at just over a month into starting coderacademy.</p>
                <p>So far the experience has been incredible.</p>
                <p>Learning in an environment like CA isn't a chore; it's fun.</p>
                <p>The instructors are great, classmates are fantastic.</p>
                <p>The worst part about CA is that we'll eventually have to re-enter the real world</p>

                <p>Music used to be my life. I would play and write and record nearly daily.</p>
                <p>I lived for the next performance. It was a better high than anything else that I've experienced</p>
                <p>Nowadays, if I go a week without touching my guitar, then it's just an average week</p>
                <p>Thankfully coding is there for me to redirect my creativity</p>

                <p>On the point of changes. My former bandmates were my best friends.</p>
                <p>We saw eachother nearly e very single day, travelled together, stayed in hotels together, performed together...</p>
                <p>They were brothers.</p>
                <p>I speak with the band's bassist frequently, but I have no idea about the lives of the other guys</p>
                <p>It's disapointing, but that's life. Give, take, grow together, grow apart.</p>
