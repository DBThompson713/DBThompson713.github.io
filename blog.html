              <p>
                It's time. I've stood on the outside for too long. I've worked
                too many jobs and started too many careers solely for money or
                short term gain.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have enrolled in coderacademy. It's time to start building
                something for the long term.

                  <p>well... it's a game specifically designed to be annoying. Which i think it accomplishes quite well
                  Oh. And it has 8 bit graphics. So that's cool</p>

                  I'm Sitting at just over a month into starting coderacademy. So far the experience has been incredible. 
                  Learning in an environment like CA isn't a chore; it's fun.
                    The instructors are great, classmates are fantastic. The worst part about CA is that we'll eventually have to re-enter the real world

                  <Nowadays,>Music used to be my life. I would play and write and record nearly daily.I lived for the next performance. 
                    It was a better high than anything else that I've experienced
                    Nowadays, if I go a week without touching my guitar, then it's just an average week</p>
                  <p>Thankfully coding is there for me to redirect my creativity</p>

                  <p>I speak with the former bassist frequently, but I have no idea about the lives of the other guys. It's disapointing, but that's life. Give, take, grow together, grow apart.</p>
