                                  I'm excited to get at it and be immersed in coding. 
                                  Looks like I'm gonna be spending a lot of time in North sydney for the next while.

                                      I'm pretty jazzed to start doing something I'm interested in. I've worked
                                      too many jobs and started too many careers solely for money or
                                      short term gain.
