                A terminal game which makes the user guess the number of items
                purchasable with 1 Bitcoin
              </p>
              <p>
                As an added wrinkle, the value of 1 bitcoin is taken live on
                every guess, which changes the correct answer on every guess

                A personal site I designed, developed and deployed to support

                site was previously deployed at www.sillygoosemobile.com , but
                the domain has been temporarily redirected.

                We presented at ACS in Barangaroo. Such an awesome space with
                such an incredible view. It was a lot of fun seeing everyones

                <p>
                  I think my project went over pretty well. I think people got
                  the joke. Another lovely day in Sydney.

                  Another long day down at the code mine. Spent all day slaving
                  over a hot tea, sitting in a beanbag chair. Thought we lost
                  Angel. Turns out he was only napping.

                  It's wet outside. On the train, it was wet inside. In the code
                  mines the humidity is juuuust right. Our computer overlords
                  demand a dry environment... and we must comply.

                Today is exactly 1 month since I started at Coderacademy. It's
                been such a ride so far. We've covered so much already. Learning
                something new everyday has been awesome, and is something I look
                forward to continuing.
